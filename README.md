# REAL - Revolutionary Education and Action League

## Who is R.E.A.L.?

The Revolutionary Education and Action League (REAL) is an organization of working-class individuals dedicated to building power within our communities. We aim to foster solidarity among those lacking resources and representation, recognizing our shared struggles with the unhoused and incarcerated.

Our mission is to ensure that basic needs are met with dignity and respect, organizing our skills and resources to address these demands.

## Who Do We Represent?

We represent those who must work to afford life's necessities. Our goal is to advocate for the interests of working-class individuals through consistent action, rather than empty promises. We challenge the exploitation and criminalization of our community, which often faces barriers to essential services like healthcare, housing, food, and water.

## Who Are the Working Class?

The working class includes individuals who contribute to society by operating critical systems and creating essential goods. Unlike those who profit from rent and debt, workers add real value to our communities but often cannot enjoy the benefits of their labor.
