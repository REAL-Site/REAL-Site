            <h2>Who is R.E.A.L.</h2>
            <h3>Revolutionary Education and Action League</h3>

            <p> REAL is an organization of working class people united with the goal of building REAL power
                within our communities.</p>

            <p> We work to build solidarity among those who lack resources and representation in our city. We recognize
                ourselves in the community we serve, and we understand that we all have more in common with the unhoused
                & the incarcerated, than we do with landlords & CEO’s.</p>

            <p> Our people need their basic needs met with dignity & respect, and we organize our skills and resources
                to meet those demands.</p>

            <h3>Who do we represent?</h3>

            <p> Those of us that must work and sell our labor to afford the basic needs necessary for life.</p>

            <p> We intend to represent the needs & interests of these working class people in our city. Not just with
                fleeting words, but with consistent action.</p>

            <p> We understand that many of those in public office will acknowledge our needs in their campaigns &
                speeches; but behind the council doors they will support bills & ordinances that only serve the
                interests of profit, at the expense of the people.</p>

            <p> We see our working class community increasingly exploited, criminalized, and barred from access to basic
                needs. Things like healthcare, housing, food & water, are placed behind paywalls and bureaucratic red
                tape that exclude those without the wealth to bypass them. The ruling class owns empty houses while the
                workers struggle to maintain shelter.</p>

            <h3>Who are the working class?</h3>

            <p> The working class is made up of folks who contribute directly to our society by working hard to operate
                critical systems such as transportation, agriculture, and healthcare, as well as by creating essential
                things like food & infrastructure.</p>

            <p> Unlike those who profit from rent, financing, and debt collecting, workers add concrete value to our
                society. More often than not, us workers cannot afford to enjoy the benefits of that which we create.
            </p>
